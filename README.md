# catch-the-light-2

This is the second version of [Catch the Light](https://github.com/sustainmain/catch-the-light), an old Arduino project I made for a carnival my elementary school hosted.

This version features five different levels, each with their unique behavior themed after an animal. Normally, the program bounces a light back and forth along a line of lights, and the player has to hit a button when the light is at either end of the line. During the Frog level, the light moves around randomly.

This version also features an LCD screen to display short messages to complement the animations and status lights that tell you when you when or what level you're on. Another change from the last version is the inclusion of comments.


## Levels
- Level 1 (Sloth): moves slowly
- Level 2 (Cow): moves slowly, but sometimes stampedes (moves faster)
- Level 3 (Frog): hops around randomly
- Level 4 (Monkey): moves quickly
- Level 5 (Cheetah): moves quickly, but rests at random intervals
